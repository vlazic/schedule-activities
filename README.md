## Technologies

This project is bootstrapped with **Create React App** (CRA) and **TypeScript** CRA template.

For project styling, I've picked the **Styled Components** library.

For application **state** management I've decided to use the **Redux** library. Redux store is configured in _store.ts_ file and other Redux related files are located in _actions/_, _reducers/_ and _selectors/_ folders.

## Development instructions

In the project directory, you can run:
